## Install

`dr-cabal` is a Haskell CLI tool and can be installed either from
Hackage or from this repository.

### Prerequisites

To start using `dr-cabal`, make sure you have the required version of
`cabal-install` (a Haskell build tool) and GHC (a Haskell compiler)
installed:

* [Cabal ‚©æ 3.6.2.0](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)
* [GHC ‚©æ 9.0.2](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/)

### Hackage

To install the latest version of `dr-cabal` from
[Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dr-cabal),
follow these steps:

1. Update Hackage index:

    ```shell
	cabal update
	```

2. Build `dr-cabal` from Hackage and copy the resulting executable
   into the desired location:

    ```shell
    cabal install dr-cabal \
        --install-method=copy \
        --overwrite-policy=always \
        --with-compiler=ghc-9.0.2 \
        --installdir=$HOME/.local/bin
	```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **NOTE:** Make sure the `$HOME/.local/bin` directory or the
> directory of your choice is listed in `$PATH`.

### Sources

To build the latest version of `dr-cabal` from sources,
follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/chshersh/dr-cabal.git
	cd dr-cabal
	```

2. Build the package:

    ```shell
	cabal build
	```

3. Copy executable to the desired location:

    ```shell
    cp $(cabal list-bin exe:dr-cabal) ~/.local/bin/dr-cabal
	```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **NOTE:** Make sure the `~/.local/bin` directory or the
> directory of your choice is listed in `$PATH`.

## How to use?

`dr-cabal` usages comprises two steps:

1. üëÄ Watching `cabal build` output and recording data into a JSON file.
2. üåà Producing pretty profiling results.

### Watch

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** To get meaningful results, the `dr-cabal watch`
> command needs to be run when none of the dependencies are build. If
> you've already build you project, including dependencies, you can
> purge global Cabal cache using the following command:
>
> ```shell
> rm -rf ~/.cabal
> ```
>
> A less invasive approach is to point Cabal to a fresh store folder,
> but in this case you won't see the `Downloading` phase in the profiling
> output:
>
> ```shell
> cabal --store-dir=$(mktemp -d) build all
> ```

Run the following command inside the project directory, for which you
want to build the profile chart:

```shell
cabal build all | dr-cabal watch --output=dr-cabal-debug.json
```

This command watches the `cabal build` output and records all the
relevant steps in the `dr-cabal-debug.json` file.

If everything is good, you should see output similar to the below one:

> It's also possible to see the time spent on Haddock. You can run with:
>
> ```shell
> cabal build all --enable-documentation --haddock-all | dr-cabal watch --output=dr-cabal-debug.json
> ```

### Profile

Once you successfully produced a JSON file with all the recorded
steps, run the following command to pretty-print the profiling output:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** For better results, make your terminal full-screen.

```shell
dr-cabal profile --input=dr-cabal-debug.json
```

You'll see the output like on the image below:
